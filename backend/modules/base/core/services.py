🔧 Services - Write Operations (Command Layer)

Services are responsible for:
- Creating, Updating, Deleting data
- Business logic and validation
- Transaction management
- Side effects (emails, notifications, etc.)

Usage:
    from modules.daemon.services import create_user

    user = create_user(email="user@example.com", password="secret")

Note:
    - Use @transaction.atomic for data consistency
    - Keep business logic here, not in views
    - Call selectors for reading, not direct ORM queries
